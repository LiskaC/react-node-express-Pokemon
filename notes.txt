DEPLOYING TO HEROKU
//heroku run bash  - blocked by network (Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 50.19.103.36:5000)
^ use to find index.html in heroku directory. Perhaps it isn't being created in client/build since:
    Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/app/client/build/index.html'

ISSUE: no build/index.html found in the app
    1) search inside heroku for where/if this file exists
    2) package.json contains     "heroku-postbuild": "npm install"  in 'scripts' - is this creating the build file when heroku builds (apparentlt successfully) or do i NEED SOMETHING ELSE TO DO THAT.


deploy to heroku - do I have to npm run build before redeploying after change?

server.js

Server:
do I need a

auth-routes.js
// Type ahead endpoint - not working, what's wrong

Client:

Compare.js - declaring constants inside vs outside components

is there a way to write all this spinning/loading just once? 
have also tried to writing into components, not sure which way to go. 
perhaps with set timeout?
