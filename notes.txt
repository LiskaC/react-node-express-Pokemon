is there a way to write all this spinning/loading just once? 
have also tried to writing into components, not sure which way to go. 
perhaps with set timeout?

How can I rig up the nav bar? does it have to be links or possible with buttons?
Really not happy with passing info across components or having them influence each other.

how do I pass info from server to client?
